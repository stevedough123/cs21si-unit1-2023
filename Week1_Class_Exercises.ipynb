        "Today we will explore gender bias in natural language processing. We will learn about our first models to probe gender bias in word vectors. As a reminder, word vectors are a machine's representation of a word, learned from reading a large corpus of text to understand the context that words are used in. For example, since the words \"good\" and \"great\" are used in similar contexts, they have similar word vectors!\n",
