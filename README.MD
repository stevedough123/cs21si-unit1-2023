## Instructions for Running Notebooks

We recommend using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to run Jupyter notebooks (the `.ipynb` files in this repository).

### Using Colab

To add a notebook to Colab, visit the [start page](https://colab.research.google.com). You will be prompted to choose a notebook to work on. Select the `GITHUB` tab to import a notebook from the class GitHub. Enter the class repo: `https://github.com/stevedough123/cs21si-unit1-2023` and press Enter. Click on the notebook of your choice, and you should be able to view a read-only copy of the notebook. To create your own copy, click the `COPY TO DRIVE` button in the toolbar near the top of the webpage. A new copy of the notebook should pop-up. You can edit this notebook, and changes will be saved to your Drive. When you need to access your copy of the notebook again, visit the start page and you will see your notebook under `GOOGLE DRIVE`.
